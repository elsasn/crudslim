A Simple CRUD API using Slim Framework. 

Welcome
Slim is a PHP micro framework that helps you quickly write simple yet powerful web applications and APIs. At its core, Slim is a dispatcher that receives an HTTP request, invokes an appropriate callback routine, and returns an HTTP response. That’s it.

What’s the point?
Slim is an ideal tool to create APIs that consume, repurpose, or publish data. Slim is also a great tool for rapid prototyping. Heck, you can even build full-featured web applications with user interfaces. More importantly, Slim is super fast and has very little code.

You don’t always need a kitchen-sink solution like Symfony or Laravel. These are great tools, for sure. But they are often overkill. Instead, Slim provides only a minimal set of tools that do what you need and nothing else.
